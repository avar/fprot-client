	* t/scan_(file|stream).t: The F-Prot engine previously did not
	flag eicar as a virus if the file had a .txt extension. It now
	flags eicar content as infected regardless of what the extension
	is. This made tests fail on the 4.4.2.54 engine but not on
	4.3.*. Since I don't know when this was introduced exactly and we
	don't need the test anyway I've commented out the scanning of
	eicar.txt so tests will pass on old and new versions of the
	engine.
